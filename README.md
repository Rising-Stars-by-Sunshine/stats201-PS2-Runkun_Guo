- **Project Summary**: 
  - Background: To predict the outcome of a certain soccer match may have a petential commercial value. We tried to find the correlation between the total number of shooting and the total number of goals in a match as a part of outcome of a match. Not many scholars are still doing research on this quite traditional gambling game theory. Thus, I want to make some improvements to this field.
  - Research Question: Does the number of shootings has correlation with the number of goals in a certain soccer match?
  - Data Source: I use the data queried from football.data.co.uk website which is a gambling website that records all the historical data for football matches in UK
  - Methods: I tried to use linear regression to predict the total numner of goals given a number of shooting and I also tried Ramdom forest Regression. Besides, I also consider the number of goals as a group of classes and I use Decision Tree Classifier to get the confusion matrix.
  - Results: From the Regression part, I found out that the accuracy of Random Forest Regression is only 19.49%. For the decision tree classification, the accuracy of f1 score is 22%. I may conclude that there's no direct or few connection between the total number of shooting and the number of goals.
  - Intellectual Merits: The result is quite opposite to my expectation that this two variables have few connections. In the beginging, I found out that the accuracy of regression is not very high, thus I try to make the discrete number as different classes and use the Decision Tree Classifier to make a prediction. However, the accuracy is still ideal enough. Therefore, based on my simulation resultes, I could only conclude my X and Y have few connections now. In the future, I may try to make my data more suitable for the models and may try to consider the discrete number into one-hot code for classification part to improve the accuracy

This figure is the prediction distribution under Linear Regression. It's obvious that the regression is not very ideal.

This Figure is the confusion matrix under Decision Tree. We can see that only few classes have a relatively strong correlation.
