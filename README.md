- **Project Summary**: 
  - Background: To predict the outcome of a certain soccer match may have a petential commercial value. We tried to find the correlation between the total number of shooting and the total number of goals in a match as a part of outcome of a match. Not many scholars are still doing research on this quite traditional gambling game theory. Thus, I want to make some improvements to this field.
  - Research Question: Does the number of shootings has correlation with the number of goals in a certain soccer match?
  - Data Source: I use the data queried from football.data.co.uk website which is a gambling website that records all the historical data for football matches in UK
  - Methods: I tried to use linear regression to predict the total numner of goals given a number of shooting and I also tried Ramdom forest Regression. Besides, I also consider the number of goals as a group of classes and I use Decision Tree Classifier to get the confusion matrix.
  - Results: From the Regression part, I found out that the accuracy of Random Forest Regression is only 19.49%. For the decision tree classification, the accuracy of f1 score is 22%. I may conclude that there's no direct or few connection between the total number of shooting and the number of goals.
  - Intellectual Merits: The result is quite opposite to my expectation that this two variables have few connections. In the beginging, I found out that the accuracy of regression is not very high, thus I try to make the discrete number as different classes and use the Decision Tree Classifier to make a prediction. However, the accuracy is still ideal enough. Therefore, based on my simulation resultes, I could only conclude my X and Y have few connections now. In the future, I may try to make my data more suitable for the models and may try to consider the discrete number into one-hot code for classification part to improve the accuracy

This Figure is the confusion matrix under Decision Tree. We can see that only few classes have a relatively strong correlation.
